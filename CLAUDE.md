# Project context

This project follows the AI Unified Process. Before making product, domain, or architecture decisions, read:

- `docs/vision.md`
- `docs/requirements.md`
- `docs/entity_model.md`
- the relevant documents under `docs/use_cases/` and `docs/test_cases/`

## Workflow rules

1. Derive requirements from the product vision.
2. Reconcile the entity model and use case diagram when requirements change.
3. Do not implement a use case before its `UC-*.md` specification exists and has been reviewed.
4. Keep requirement, use case, and test case identifiers stable and traceable in code and tests.
5. Use the installed stack plugin for migrations, implementation, and testing.
6. Review and preserve the conventions already established in the codebase.

## Verification

Run the project's documented build, static analysis, and test commands after implementation. Report any verification
that could not be completed.
